Introduction: 
=============

This is the readme belonging to the Trueport for Solaris software. 


TruePort creates standard UNIX TTY's in the /dev/term/ directory. Each TTY is 
connected to a unique TCP/IP port number on the device server. This port 
number is used to uniquely identify the port and the connection to the UNIX 
server computer.

TruePort is a virtual serial port device driver for the Perle Device/Terminal 
servers. This version will only install and operate correctly on the
platform (INTEL/SPARC) supported by that release. Please ensure you have the 
correct software for your computer processor type. The installation image name
indicates the platform type the software is intended to run on.

TruePort for Solaris is a TTY serial port emulation system for the Perle 
device/terminal server families. TruePort provides a standard TTY interface to 
application software which is achieved using the TruePort serial device driver.


Full TruePort protocol will allow an application to take full control of the 
remote serial port and use all functions available e.g. setting baud rates, flow
control settings and raising and lowering modem pins etc.

TruePort Lite Mode will allow an application to just transmit and receive data 
to and from the port.  Any baud rates or flow control settings must be 
configured on the terminal server before the application is started.

TruePort supports the following Perle hardware in TruePort Full Mode
protocol:
    - All IOLAN Family Models, including DS, TS, SDS, STS, SCS
    - JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000
    - LanStream 2000
    - LinkStream 2000.

It also supports IOLAN+ and other 3rd party multi-port terminal servers in Lite
(raw) mode.
NOTE: 	
For TruePort Full Mode the JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000 and LanStream 2000 
require firmware version 2.3.3 or later and the LinkStream 2000 requires 
version 6.04 or later.


Installation and Configuration:
===============================

Copy the supplied installable files onto the filesystem of the host computer, 
we recommend /tmp.

Before installation, make sure that you are logged in as the root user.

Install the device drivers with the following commands:

# cd /tmp
# uncompress tpsol-<version>.<arch>.pkg.Z
# pkgadd -d /tmp/tpsol-<version>.<arch>.pkg all

You will be prompted to allow super user permissions. The files will be 
installed and the device drivers will be loaded. You do not need to reboot.

TruePort administrative files and utilities are installed in 
the /etc/trueport directory.

The standard installation installs 64 minor node devices (ports), however you 
must enable these ports before they can be used. Each installed TTY is assigned 
a name by the operating system; this will be in the range 0-63 if you have no 
previous multi-port serial installation. You may link these names to your own 
TTY names if you require.

The standard installation creates device nodes /dev/term/0 through /dev/term/63.
To enable a range of ports, we have provided a script /etc/trueport/addports
that starts the TruePort service. The "addports" command edits the TruePort 
configuration files and starts the required daemons and drivers.  

Once the "addports" command has configured the system, TruePort will be started 
automatically on each system reboot.

Once the ports have been enabled, you may use them as standard UNIX serial TTY's.

See the TruePort Solaris User Guide for more information on the use of this 
script and other configuration utilities.

Known Issues:
=============
 * If configuring Lite mode devices for Logins using Perle tplogin scripts
   on Solaris 10 or higher the login prompt may not appear following a reboot of 
   the system.  To recover the login prompts on the Lite mode devices you will 
   need to perform the following command manually or in a script file.
      sacadm -x -p <pmtag>
         where <pmtag> is the port monitory tag, for example trumon
