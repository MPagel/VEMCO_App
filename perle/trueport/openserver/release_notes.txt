         Perle TruePort Daemon and Driver for SCO OpenServer 6
           Copyright (C) 2004-2008, Perle Systems Limited
=============================================================================
  Release           : 6.2.0
  Date              : November 2008 
  O/S Compatibility : SCO Unixware 7.x
=============================================================================

Introduction: 
=============

This is the readme belonging to the Trueport for OpenServer 6 software. 

TruePort creates standard UNIX TTY's in the /dev/term/ directory. Each TTY is 
connected to a unique TCP/IP port number on the device server. This port 
number is used to uniquely identify the port and the connection to the UNIX 
server computer.


TruePort for OpenServer 6 is a TTY serial port emulation system for the Perle 
device/terminal server families. TruePort provides a standard TTY interface to 
application software which is achieved using the TruePort serial device driver.


TruePort Full mode protocol will allow an application to take full control of the 
remote serial port and use all functions available e.g. setting baud rates, flow
control settings and raising and lowering modem pins etc.

TruePort Lite Mode will allow an application to just transmit and receive data 
to and from the port.  Any baud rates or flow control settings must be 
configured on the terminal server before the application is started.

TruePort supports the following Perle hardware in TruePort Full Mode
protocol:
    - All IOLAN Family Models, including DS, TS, SDS, STS, SCS
    - JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000
    - LanStream 2000
    - LinkStream 2000.

It also supports IOLAN+ and other 3rd party multi-port terminal servers in Lite
(raw) mode.

NOTE: 	
For TruePort Full Mode the JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000 and LanStream 2000 
require firmware version 2.3.3 or later and the LinkStream 2000 requires 
version 6.04 or later.


Installation and Configuration:
===============================

Copy the supplied installable files onto the filesystem of the host computer, 
we recommend /tmp.

Before installation, make sure that you are logged in as the root user.

Install the device drivers with the following commands:

# cd /tmp
# uncompress tpos6-<version>.pkg.Z
# pkgadd -d /tmp/tpos6-<version>.pkg all

You will be prompted to allow super user permissions. The files will be 
installed and the device drivers will be loaded. You now need to reboot for
the driver to complete the installation.

TruePort administrative files and utilities are installed in 
the /etc/trueport directory.

The standard installation installs 256 minor node devices (ports), however you 
must enable these ports before they can be used. Each installed TTY is assigned 
a name by the operating system; this will be in the range 0-255 if you have no 
previous multi-port serial installation. You may link these names to your own 
TTY names if you require.

The standard installation creates device nodes /dev/tty[sS]0 through 
/dev/tty[sS]255.  To enable a range of ports, we have provided a script 
/etc/trueport/addports that starts the TruePort service. The "addports" command 
edits the TruePort configuration files and starts the required daemons and 
drivers.  

Once the "addports" command has configured the system, TruePort will be started 
automatically on each system reboot.

Once the ports have been enabled, you may use them as standard UNIX serial TTY's.

See the TruePort OpenServer 6 User Guide for more information on the use of this 
script and other configuration utilities.

Tuning your system
==================

System Processes:

For both Full and Lite modes the system will require 1 process for each TruePort
port, in addition to all other processes running including any
services that use the ports. To check and change the maximum number of processes
allowed, you can use the SCO Admin application or the idtune command.

With SCO Admin, use the System Tuner application in the System section. The
parameter is NPROC in the Process Limit Parameters group.

To check the maximum processes using the idtune command use:
#/etc/conf/bin/idtune -g NPROC
The first number is the current setting. The last number is highest value that
can be set.

To set it, use the following commands:
# /etc/conf/bin/idtune -c -f NPROC num
# /etc/conf/bin/idbuild -K
where num is the value to set. The system must be rebooted for the new value to
take effect.


Pseudo TTYs (ptys): 
===================
For Lite mode when a port is configured for Server mode, a pseudo TTY device is 
needed for each TruePort port in addition to any pseudo ttys needed for other 
purposes. To check the current number of ptys available, you can use the 
SCO Admin application or the idtune command.

With SCO Admin, use the System Tuner in the System section. The parameter is
NUMREGPT in the Device Driver Parameters group.

To check the number of ptys using the idtune command use 
# /etc/conf/bin/idtune -g NUMREGPT
The first number is the current setting. The last number is highest value that
can be set.

To set the number of pseudo TTYs supported, the nsu (Network Support Utilities)
package, provided with the system, must be reinstalled. During installation of
the package, you will be prompted for the number of pseudo TTYs to create. The
system must be rebooted for the new value to take effect.
